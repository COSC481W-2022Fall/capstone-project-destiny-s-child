# Destiny's Child




Hi, my name is Mohamad Chaker! The backend developer on the team. My work will be fullstack leaning more towards backend. I have done some mobile development with swift/xcode but not java/android-studio so I think this will be a great learning opportunity.

Hello! My name is Destiny Haist. I am the team lead for Destiny's Child. My work will be frontend leaning. I have experience working in Android Studio, and I look forward to developing an app I will be proud to show to people.
